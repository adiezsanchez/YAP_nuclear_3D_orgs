<h1>(YAP-LOC3D) - Quantifying Nuclear Translocation of YAP in 3D Organoids Using CellposeSAM and Pyclesperanto-Based Morphological Operations</h1>

This project focuses on analyzing the nuclear translocation of YAP (protein) using a pretrained [CellposeSAM](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.04.28.651001v1) model for 3D instance segmentation of nuclei and morphological operations from [pyclesperanto](https://github.com/clEsperanto/pyclesperanto_prototype) to simulate the cytoplasm surrounding the nuclei. The primary goal is to quantify the intensity of YAP in the nucleus and cytoplasm across various experimental conditions, based on this a ratio is calculated to elucidate where YAP localizes.

> [!TIP]
> If you want to use the latest in environment managers I do recommend switching to [Pixi](https://pixi.sh/latest/installation/), it will pay off in the short term. 

After installing pixi, type the following command and enjoy the fastest venv manager in the market. After it is done installing your virtual environment it will launch a Jupyter Server in your browser so you can interact with the pipelines.

<code>cd YAP_nuclear_3D_orgs && pixi run lab</code>

<h2>Workflow summary</h2>

**Notebook 1: Single-image QC (`1_SP_3D_Cellpose_YAP_nuc_cyt_ratio.ipynb`)**

- Loads one `.czi` file (`io_utils.list_images`), parses `experiment_id`, `mouse_id`, `treatment_id`, `replica_id`, and visualizes channels in napari.
- Reads voxel size from CZI metadata (`utils.extract_scaling_metadata`) and computes anisotropy correction for 3D CellposeSAM.
- Predicts nuclei labels (`utils.predict_nuclei_labels`) or reloads cached labels (`io_utils.load_precomputed_results_if_available`) and writes outputs to structured folders (`io_utils.ensure_output_dir`).
- Simulates cytoplasm shells by nucleus dilation (`utils.simulate_cytoplasm`) and segments parent organoids from nuclei seeds (`utils.segment_organoids_from_cp_labels`).
- Measures YAP mean intensity and volume in nuclei/cytoplasm (`skimage.measure.regionprops_table`), computes `nuclei_cyto_ratio`, maps nuclei to parent organoids and merges organoid morphology features (`data_analysis_utils.extract_organoid_stats_and_merge`), and enables label-level QC overlays (`utils.map_df_column_to_labels`).

**Notebook 2: Batch processing (`2_BP_3D_Cellpose_YAP_nuc_cyt_ratio.ipynb`)**

- Runs the same core segmentation + quantification logic for all `.czi` images in a folder.
- Reuses cached nuclei labels when present; otherwise infers and saves new labels per image.
- Includes a shape-mismatch safeguard: if cached labels do not match current YAP image shape, labels are recomputed and overwritten.
- Exports one per-label CSV with metadata, nuclei/cytoplasm intensities, nuclei/cytoplasm volumes, `nuclei_cyto_ratio`, and organoid-level context in `results/bp_results/<input_folder>/`.

**Notebook 3: Downstream analysis (`3_Data_analysis_plotting.ipynb`)**

- Loads per-label batch CSVs for WT and tumor datasets.
- Visualizes nuclei volume distributions (`data_analysis_utils.plot_nuclei_volume_distribution`) to set dataset-specific `MIN_MAX_NUCLEI_VOLUME`.
- Filters by nuclei volume and removes orphan nuclei (`organoid_id == 0`) before aggregation.
- Computes technical replicate means (`data_analysis_utils.calculate_technical_replicates_mean_values`) and plots treatment-level boxplots (`data_analysis_utils.plot_boxplots_by_features`).
- Computes biological replicate means (`data_analysis_utils.calculate_biological_replicates_mean_values`), plots treatment-ordered scatter + group means (`data_analysis_utils.plot_scatter_nuclei_cyto_ratio`), and runs Welch t-tests/1-way ANOVA summaries (`data_analysis_utils.calculate_statistical_tests`).

<h2>Materials and Methods: Image Analysis</h2>

3D `.czi` organoid images were analyzed with a CellposeSAM-based nuclei segmentation workflow followed by morphology-guided cytoplasm simulation. For each image, voxel scaling metadata was extracted to compute anisotropy-corrected nuclei inference in 3D. Predicted nuclei labels were optionally filtered by volume, and per-nucleus cytoplasmic shells were generated by controlled dilation. Nuclei were mapped to parent organoid masks to preserve organoid context.

YAP signal quantification was performed as mean intensity in nucleus and simulated cytoplasm for each label, together with nucleus/cytoplasm volumes. A per-label YAP nuclear-to-cytoplasmic ratio (`nuclei_cyto_ratio`) was then computed. Batch outputs were consolidated into CSV files, filtered using volume thresholds and orphan-label exclusion, and summarized at technical-replicate and biological-replicate levels. Treatment-level comparisons were visualized with box/scatter plots and tested using Welch's t-tests and one-way ANOVA.
